# Final_Project: MarketUpdates

High level ideas:
 - User can pull from Yahoo Finance API by APIdojo.net it will have a search function for market news and stocks.

##User story & user flows:
 - user will register/Login
 - Navbar will display functions
 
##Technologies Implemented


##MVP in Trello and create mockup data:
 - MERN stack application
 - Wireframe added to README.md
 - Backend:  RESTful API that supports CRUD operations with MongoDB and Mongoose.  
 - Maybe a User and post model. So I will add user Auth again as a stretch goal.
 - Implement front end logic and UI
 - Connect frontend and backend using AJAX HTTP requests.
 - New technologies: going to use Grid for layout, Skeleton for color schemes, and would like to implement google maps as a stretch goal.
 - deployment on Heroku
